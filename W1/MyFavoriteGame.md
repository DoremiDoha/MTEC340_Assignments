- **Name:** NieR:Automata
- **Great things about the game:** It has such a great graphic visuals! All of their sound tracks are so beautiful and touching. I never felt beautiful when I was in combats in other games, but playing this game, I really felt lots of satisfaction and eexcitement from the beauty of their fantastic visuals.
